## Project Overview
This project involves the use of Classification Neural Networks to predict whether an individual is likely to pickup a health insurance cover. The 
project applies the Keras Deep Learning Framework to fit A neural Network to a dataset containing socialdemographic features of individuals.

The Project also attempts to Find out the effect of Class Imbalance on classification ALgorithms
